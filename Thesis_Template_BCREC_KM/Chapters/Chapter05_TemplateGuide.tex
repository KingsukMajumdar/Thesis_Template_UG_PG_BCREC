\chapter{LaTeX Thesis Template Usage Guide}
\label{ch:template_guide}
\justifying

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The main aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive guide for using the LaTeX thesis template specifically designed for Dr. B. C. Roy Engineering College. This template has been developed to streamline the thesis writing process for both undergraduate and postgraduate students while maintaining institutional formatting standards and academic presentation quality.

The template architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation between user inputs and system-level formatting commands. The primary advantage of this template lies in its automated handling of multi-student configurations, conditional rendering of content based on degree type, and professional formatting that adheres to institutional guidelines.

\section{Template Architecture and Directory Structure}
\label{sec:architecture}

The template follows a well-organized hierarchical structure that facilitates easy content management and compilation. The complete directory structure is presented below:
